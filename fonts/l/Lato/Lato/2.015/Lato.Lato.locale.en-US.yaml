ShortDescription: A sanserif typeface family with nine weights and warm, friendly character.
Description: Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed by Łukasz Dziedzic in 2010. It features nine weights (Hairline to Black) with corresponding italics, supporting 100+ Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages, and Greek. The family balances transparency in body text with distinctive traits in larger sizes, combining classical proportions with a modern sanserif look and semi-rounded details that give it warmth and stability.
